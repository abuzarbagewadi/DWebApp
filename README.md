* "Fragile privacy through messaging applications"
  
    and
* "Immobility of work that depend upon them when they become non-functional for a brief amount of time"

    are the two basic problems frequently faced by all messaging applications. We intend to eradicate these problems  by making a messaging application that is of decentralised nature unlike the existing centralised ones. The data for which would be saved at different nodes rather than maintaining a single database. We aim at improving the existing products using latest technologies for a secure and reliable tomorrow.

## Unique Selling Points

1.	You don’t lose your privacy to big organisations like Google, Facebook as DApps’ database is not concentrated with any one organization. 
2.	Data leak is more prominent in centralized apps owing to vulnerabilities that may exist in the database. This problem is majorly solved by DApps.
3.	Application breakdown risks are minimized as there is no centralization at the server.
4.	DApps allow end to end encryption
5.	With the advent of WebRTC, developers gained the ability to exchange high quality voice and video calls – but no standard way to actually route the calls.
DApps could be the technology for missing signaling layer for webRTC.
6.	DApps have the ability to bridge between different apps and IRCs like Slack, Gitter, WhatsApp etc.

## Implementation
We use Solidity programming to make a Distributed Web Application.

## Technology Stack
* BLockchian (Solidity)
* HTML5 + CSS3
* Javascript

## Challenges

* Implementation of blockchain instead of regular servers
